## About The Project

Even with the involvement of technology in many sectors, property is still operating with the same
old ways with manual entries for renting. This project will focus on the need for a system which
can be used easily by any owner who have difficulty in maintaining records of his/her tenants. This
product is best for the persons dealing with more than one house for rent (having more property)
but can also be used for individuals. 

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to reduce the difficulties to find rental house for students
who want to rent houses/apartments. It is tiresome for the people to find houses manually, walking from apartment to apartment asking for vacancies as it needs more
human power and time. Also tenants can’t find detailed information about the rental houses. On the contrary, it is difficult for
the house owner to get perfect tenant. Owners sometimes wait a long time to rent their house. To
solve this problem, we need a computerized system so that anyone can easily find their desired
home.
